This is an example project for commanding intermec printer on Flutter app UI.

Base command functions are written on kotlin in the android files by using intermec's library.

And prepared a basic UI on flutter for accessing the library methods via Method Channels.

This is an old project so excuse the thrash coding please ;;)
